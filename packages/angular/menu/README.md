# @cocokits/angular-menu
The `@cocokits/angular-menu` package provides essential components and directives to create interactive and dynamic menus within your Angular applications. These menus display a list of actions or options, making them a flexible solution for enhancing navigation and user interaction.

## Included Component/Directive:
This package includes the following components and directives:

- `MenuComponent`

### MenuComponent
The `MenuComponent` is a floating panel that displays a structured list of actions or options in response to user interactions like clicks, hovers, or other triggers. This component is ideal for providing users with multiple choices in a compact and intuitive interface.

#### Features:
- **Dynamic Menu Display:** The menu appears when triggered by various user actions, such as button clicks or hovering, enhancing the user experience with quick access to options.
- **Structured Options Presentation:** Presents actions or options in an organized manner, making navigation within the application more intuitive.
- **Theming Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with a wide range of design system themes, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing experience across different interface styles.


### MenuItemsDirective
The `MenuItemsDirective` is used to define the items or options within the `MenuComponent`. This directive allows for flexible and customizable lists of actions, ensuring that the menu adapts to the specific needs of your application.

### MenuTriggerDirective
The `MenuTriggerDirective` is responsible for controlling how and when the `MenuComponent` is triggered. Whether the menu is activated by a click, hover, or focus, the directive provides easy-to-configure triggers for showing or hiding the menu.

## Styling and Theming
The components in this package do not include built-in styles. However, `@cocokits/angular-menu` adds CSS classes based on your configuration, allowing you to style the menu elements with your own CSS or integrate a theme from CocoKits.

`CocoKits` provides ready-made theming options, but you can also style the components yourself using custom CSS or SCSS to suit your design needs.
