  # CSS Selectors for Theme Implementation

  This documentation provides a detailed overview of the CSS selectors used in our components.
  Each selector is crucial for ensuring that the themes defined in our library are implemented consistently and effectively.

  This document serves as a reference for designers and developers, detailing how each selector should be utilized and integrated within the theme.
  By following the guidelines provided here, you can ensure that the design system is accurately represented in the source code, maintaining visual consistency across all components.
  This resource is essential for understanding the relationship between our design system and its corresponding CSS implementations.

  Each selector is associated with specific properties and a usage context that explains when and how the selector is applied to the DOM.
  The table below lists each CSS selector along with its description, properties, and activation context.
  This information helps developers understand the specific scenarios in which these selectors will be available or applied to DOM elements.

  - **Selector:** The specific CSS class that will be appended to the component.
  - **Properties:** Suggested CSS properties associated with the selector. This list is a guideline and represents the minimum design requirements. You can add other CSS properties to the class to modify the appearance as needed. For example, if background-color is suggested, you can also use background to achieve the same result.
  - **Description:** A brief explanation of the selector's purpose and the conditions under which it will be applied to the DOM.
