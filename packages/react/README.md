# Angular

## Overview

The `React` folder houses all react-specific packages within our workspace.
Each package within this folder is designed to operate independently but can also import functionalities from other packages as needed.
This modular approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of our React projects.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Packages:** Each package is self-contained with its own set of functionalities and can be developed and deployed independently.
- **Interoperability:** While packages are standalone, they can import and utilize functionalities from other packages, allowing for reusable code and efficient development.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Every package comes with its own tests to ensure reliability and robustness.
- **UI Components:** Includes UI code specific to react, providing ready-to-use components for faster development.
- **Storybook Integration:** Each package includes a Storybook configuration to visualize and test UI components in isolation, facilitating easier component development and debugging.
