## Key Components Overview:

### ChipList
The `ChipList` is designed to organize and display a group of chips efficiently, representing individual items or actions. This component improves the UI's clarity and helps manage multiple elements at a glance.

### Chip
The `Chip` is a versatile element used to display compact pieces of information such as inputs, tags, or actions. It provides an interactive way to present essential data in a concise format.

### FormField
The `FormField` acts as a wrapper for form inputs, labels, and validation messages. It ensures proper structure and alignment, enhancing form usability by applying consistent styles and spacing across form elements.

The following components work within the FormField for a cohesive form layout:
- `Input`
- `Textarea`
- `Select`
- `ChipList`

### Input
The `Input` allows users to enter and edit data in various forms. It's highly customizable and fits different data entry scenarios, from simple text to complex input fields.

### Select
The `Select` enables users to choose options from a dropdown list, making it perfect for forms where predefined selections are required.

### Textarea
The `Textarea` allows users to input and edit multiple lines of text. It is ideal for detailed information or comments and provides a spacious and flexible input area.

## Styling and Theming
As with other CocoKits components, these form-related components do not come with built-in styles but apply CSS classes based on configuration. This allows you to style them or use CocoKits' theming options for a consistent look across your application.
