# @cocokits/react-radio
The `@cocokits/react-radio` package provides essential UI components for implementing radio buttons and radio groups within React applications. These components are designed to ensure a consistent and accessible user experience, allowing users to select a single option from a set of mutually exclusive choices. The package integrates with various design system themes, making it adaptable to different application styles and ensuring seamless design consistency.

This package includes the following components:

- `RadioButton`
- `RadioGroup`

### RadioButton
The `RadioButton` allows users to select one option from a predefined set of choices. It is commonly used in forms or settings where only one option should be selected at a time.

#### Features:
- **Single Selection:** Ensures only one option can be selected from a group, helping users make clear and definitive choices.
- **Theming Compatibility:** Works with multiple design system themes, providing visual consistency across the application.
- **Form Integration:** Easily integrates with forms, making it simple to collect user input in a structured and accessible way.

### RadioGroup
The `RadioGroup` is a container that groups multiple `RadioButton` components. It ensures that only one radio button can be selected at a time, helping organize and manage the selection of mutually exclusive options.

#### Features:
- **Group Management:** Organizes multiple RadioButton components into a group, ensuring only one option can be selected.
- **Theming Compatibility:** Integrates with different design system themes, ensuring a cohesive look and feel across your application.
- **Accessibility:** Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring that users can easily navigate and select options within the group.

## Styling and Theming
The components in this package do not include built-in styles. However, `@cocokits/react-radio` applies CSS classes based on your configuration, allowing for easy styling using custom CSS or a theme from CocoKits.

CocoKits offers ready-made theming options, or you can style the components yourself using your own CSS or SCSS to meet your design requirements.
