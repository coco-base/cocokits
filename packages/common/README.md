# Common

## Overview

The `common` folder serves as a central hub for utilities and shared resources within our workspace.
This folder contains various packages that provide functionality needed across multiple projects, frameworks and packages.
By centralizing these resources, we aim to ensure consistency and reuse of code, ultimately enhancing the maintainability of our projects.

Included within this folder are helpers for data formatting, common interface definitions, shared constants, and more.
These utilities are designed to support diverse needs while maintaining a cohesive development environment.


## Key Features

- **Data Formatting:** Utilities that help in standardizing and manipulating data formats used across different applications or packages.
- **Interface Definitions:** Common interfaces that ensure consistent contract definitions across various components and services.
- **Shared Constants:** A collection of constants used throughout projects or packages to maintain consistency in configurations and parameter values.
