# Internal
The `internal` folder contains all internal packages that are utilized within our workspace.
These packages are not intended for external publication or independent build processes.
Instead, they are crafted to support and enhance the functionality of other publishable packages within our workspace.


## Contributing

While these packages are internal, improvements and updates are crucial for maintaining efficiency and effectiveness. To contribute:

1. **Understand the Impact:** Be aware that changes to these packages might affect multiple projects within the workspace.
2. **Propose Changes:** Suggest improvements or report issues to ensure that these packages continue to meet the evolving needs of our workspace.
3. **Update Documentation:** Keep documentation within and related to these packages up-to-date to ensure clarity and ease of use for all team members.

## Guidelines

- **No External Publication:** Ensure that these packages remain internal and are not made available publicly.
- **Maintain Isolation:** While these packages can interact with other workspace elements, they should not introduce dependencies that could affect the buildability or publishability of public packages.

## Conclusion

The `internal` folder plays a critical role in our development ecosystem, providing essential services and utilities that streamline our development processes. If you need further information or assistance, refer to the main repository documentation or reach out to the project maintainers.

Thank you for contributing to the success of our internal infrastructure!
