We would love for you to contribute to Cocokits and help make it even better than it is today!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [CocoKits Architect](./?path=/docs/contributing-architect--docs)
- [Workspace Structure](./?path=/docs/contributing-workspace-structure--docs)
- [Kits Doc Structure](./?path=/docs/contributing-kits-doc-structure--docs)
- [Component Examples](./?path=/docs/contributing-component-examples--docs)
- [Commit Message](./?path=/docs/contributing-commit--docs)
- [Branch Naming](./?path=/docs/contributing-branch-naming--docs)


## Contribution Workflow

- **Clone the Repository:** Clone the main repository to your local machine
- **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes and follow the [branch naming convention](./?path=/docs/contributing-branch-naming--docs)
- **Make Your Changes:** Work on your changes locally and commit them with clear and follow [commit message convention](./?path=/docs/contributing-commit--docs).
- **Push Your Changes:** Push your branch to the remote repository
- **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**
  - Create a PR from your branch to the main branch of the repository.
  - Include a clear description of the changes, the purpose of the PR, and any relevant context.
  - Request a review from the core team members.
- **Core Team Review and Merge:** The author of the PR cannot merge it. A core team member will review the PR, provide feedback, and merge it into the main branch once it is approved and all CI checks pass.
- **Clean Up:** After the PR is merged, delete the feature branch to keep the repository clean:
