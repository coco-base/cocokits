1. **Make Your Changes:** Work on your changes locally and commit them with clear and follow [commit message convention](./?path=/docs/contributing-commit--docs).
1. **Write Tests:** Update existing tests or add new ones to cover your changes. This helps maintain reliability and stability.
1. **Document Changes:** Update any relevant documentation within the package to reflect your changes. And make sure all the changes covered by JsDoc comments with `@example` tag.
1. **Update Changes Log:** Use `changesset` to add all changes log.
    - Run `pnpm changeset add` to create a new changeset.
    - Select the packages that are affected by your changes.
    - Choose the bump type for each package. 
      - **major**: Breaking changes, choose the packages that have breaking changes and keep if empty if no breaking changes.
      - **minor**: New features, choose the packages that have new features, and keep it empty if no new features.

1. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**
    - Create a PR from your branch to the main branch of the repository.
    - Include a clear description of the changes, the purpose of the PR, and any relevant context.
    - Request a review from the core team members.
1. **Core Team Review and Merge:** The author of the PR cannot merge it. A core team member will review the PR, provide feedback, and merge it into the main branch once it is approved and all CI checks pass.
