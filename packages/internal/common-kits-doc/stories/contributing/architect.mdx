---

## Core Foundation
At the heart of CocoKits is the `@cocokits/core` package, which serves as the foundation for all UI components across the ecosystem.
This package provides essential configuration options, handles theming, and generates the necessary CSS selectors to ensure
consistent styling and functionality across different frameworks. It ensures seamless integration with any design system,
offering a cohesive and customizable experience for developers and designers alike.

## Platform Specific Core
To support framework specific implementations, CocoKits offers `@cocokits/angular-core` and `@cocokits/react-core`.
These packages provide the foundational functionality required by CocoKits UI libraries to operate within Angular or React environments.
While they do not include any UI components, they contain essential tokens, providers, and configurations that enable the UI libraries
to function properly.

---

## UI Components
The CocoKits Angular and React UI libraries deliver essential components with a focus on unstyled, functional elements.
These components, such as responsive forms and interactive controls, provide all the necessary functionality without imposing any visual styling.
This approach gives developers complete control over the application’s look and feel, ensuring flexibility and alignment with any design system.

## Component Development Kits (CDK)
To simplify the integration of essential utilities, CocoKits provides `@cocokits/angular-cdk` and `@cocokits/react-cdk`.
These packages act as wrappers around Angular CDK or React ARIA/Headless UI libraries, offering pre configured utilities
for accessibility, overlays, keyboard navigation, and more. By bundling these utilities into a single package, CocoKits
streamlines the development workflow and reduces dependency management overhead.

---

## Utilities
CocoKits includes a suite of utility packages to enhance development efficiency.

#### Common Utils
These are the common utilities that can be used across different frameworks. They are pure TypeScript utilities with no dependencies,
allowing you to easily incorporate them into any application—even if you don't plan on using any UI components.

#### React Utils
The `@cocokits/react-utils` package is a collection of essential utilities and custom hooks specifically designed for React projects.
Tailored for design systems and UI components, it provides optimized helpers that integrate seamlessly into React-based workflows without
the traditional "Component" suffix for UI parts.

#### Angular Utils
The `@cocokits/angular-utils` package is a versatile utility library developed specifically for Angular applications.
It offers essential utilities and helper functions designed to streamline Angular development. This package makes it easier to handle
common tasks while offering Angular specific features such as custom pipes, signals, and more.

## Theming Libraries
Each theme in our workspace styles the components based on its own configuration and exports all available tokens so you can easily use
them in your application or extend the current design. You can use one theme or combine multiple themes together to style the components
according to your requirements or even create your own theme library.

#### Cocokits Theme
The `@cocokits/theme-cocokits` package is the official theme designed by the CocoKits team.
It provides a balanced, cohesive, and visually consistent appearance across all CocoKits components.
This theme integrates seamlessly with the CocoKits library, ensuring that all UI elements maintain a unified look and feel while allowing
for easy customization to match specific project requirements.

#### FramesX Theme
The `@cocokits/themes-frames-x` package offers a modern and innovative design theme that brings a fresh,
distinctive style to CocoKits components. This theme is ideal for projects that aim to stand out with a unique and visually
engaging user interface. For an enhanced visual experience, check out the Frames X UI Kits which deliver a bold and contemporary
look while maintaining functionality and ease of use.
