This document outlines the branch naming conventions and trunk-based development strategy used in our project.
Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency, clarity, and efficiency in our development workflow.

## Branch Naming Convention
All branches must follow a specific naming pattern to make it easy to identify the purpose and scope of
the branch. The format is as follows:

```
scope/subscope
```

### Scope
The scope indicates the type of work being done. It must be one of the following:

- chore: For tasks that do not directly impact the application's functionality, such as updating dependencies, tooling, or configuration files.
- feat: For new features or enhancements to existing functionality.
- fix: For bug fixes or patches.
- doc: For documentation updates or additions.

### Subscope
The subscope provides additional context about the branch. It typically includes the library or area
of the application being worked on. This part is optional but highly recommended for clarity.

## Examples of Branch Names
Feature for a new button component in the button library:
```
feat/new-primary-button
```

Bug fix for the form-field library:
```
fix/form-field-validation
```

Documentation update for the select component:
```
doc/select-examples
```

Chore task for updating dependencies:
```
chore/dependency-update
```
