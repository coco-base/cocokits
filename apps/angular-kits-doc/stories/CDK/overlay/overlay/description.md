The `Overlay` CDK (Component Dev Kit) from `@cocokits` is a flexible utility that allows developers to create floating panels or elements that are positioned dynamically over the main content of an application. It is used to manage popups, modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and other temporary UI elements. The `Overlay` CDK provides robust control over placement, behavior, and interactions of overlay components, enhancing the user experience by offering non-intrusive, context-sensitive content.

#### Features:

- **Dynamic Positioning:** Provides advanced positioning strategies for floating elements, ensuring overlays are placed in the optimal position relative to the trigger element or the viewport.
- **Dismissable Interactions:** Supports user interactions such as clicks outside the overlay or pressing the escape key to dismiss the overlay, providing intuitive controls to close temporary UI elements.
- **Backdrop Support:** Optionally includes backdrop functionality to dim the underlying content when the overlay is active, drawing the user's attention to the overlay while maintaining focus on the interactive area.
- **Scroll Management:** Manages scroll behaviors effectively, preventing content scrolling when modals or other overlays are open, thereby maintaining user focus and improving the usability of overlay elements.
- **Animations:** Offers support for custom animations, allowing overlays to appear and disappear with smooth transitions, contributing to a polished and engaging user experience.
