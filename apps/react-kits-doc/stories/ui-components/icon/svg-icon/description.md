The `SvgIcon` from `@cocokits` allows for the dynamic embedding of SVG icons within your React applications.


#### Features:

- **Flexible Icon Sizing:** Icons can be specified with sizes using the IconSize enum. If the size is set to null, the icon will inherit styles from its parent, maintaining flexibility across various layouts and design needs.
- **Theme-Compatible Colors:** Set the iconâ€™s color through the BaseColor enum or opt for no specific color (null), letting the icon inherit styles from the surrounding elements. This is particularly useful when integrating with custom CSS for unique design requirements.
- **Theme Integration:** Select an SVG icon from your theme, and the component handles the rest, ensuring it aligns perfectly with your application's look and feel.
