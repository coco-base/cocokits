The `Radio` from `@cocokits` is a container that organizes multiple `RadioButton` components, allowing users to select a single option from a group of two or more items. This component ensures that only one option can be selected at a time, providing a clear and intuitive way to handle mutually exclusive choices within forms or settings. It integrates seamlessly with multiple design system themes, ensuring a cohesive and accessible user experience across different application styles.
